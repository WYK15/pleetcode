Mr. Johnson had never been up in an aerophane before and he had read a lot about air accidents,
 so one day when a friend offered to take him for a ride in his own small phane,
 Mr. Johnson was very worried about accepting. Finally,
 however, his friend persuaded him that it was very safe,
and Mr. Johnson boarded the plane.
